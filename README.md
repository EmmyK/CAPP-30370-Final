================

This is my final project for Web Development CAPP 30370.  
I have chosen to make a website that includes the recipes of my favorite things to make to eat.
I love to cook, and so I thought I would share my favorite things with you for this project.

### Explanation of Starred Items:

>2 Breakpoints:
I chose to put my breakpoints on my main page.  Since I had four categories, I used the breakpoints to display these
in a more use friendly way.  I used flex, as it requires fewer lines of code.  At desktop view, all four categories are 
in a single column, as the screen is wide enough to allow this.  In tablet view, The categories are 2x2.  In mobile view,
the categories are all in one column.

>1 page with 3 columns:
On my page for the Chicken Wing recipe, I have three columns.  I used float to create these columns.  Each column
shows a different aspect of the recipe.  The page looks full when you open the browser window to this layout.

>1 continued loop CSS animation:
On the page for the tomato recipe, I created a scrolling marquee across the bottom of the page.  This marquee goes back
and forth with no user interaction.

>1 animation that runs on user interaction:
This animation is on the page for the potatoes.  When a user hovers over the image of the potato, the image should expand.


>1 background image:
the background image is the background to the title on the page for the egg stuffed potatoes.  It reaches all the way 
across the page to form a banner for the title.

>include 1 jquery interaction:
This animation is on my page for the snickerdoodle cookies.  When you click on the image of the cookies, it expands
and you get rounded corners on the image.
